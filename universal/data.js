// The U.S. Administration on Aging (AoA) says that, “although the exact nature of the emergency
// cannot be predicted, there are preparations that apply to almost any kind of disaster.” AoA suggests that
// older adults and their families:
// 1) develop a family communication plan so that the whereabouts and well-being of every family
// member is reported to a key person(s) during a disaster;
// 2) plan how to keep informed of developments in the disaster situation by telephone, cell phone,
// computer, radio, television, or newspaper;
// 3) identify a meeting place away from home that is reasonably familiar and convenient for all family
// members;
// 4) maintain a supply of personal, health, and home supplies, including a two-week supply of
// prescription medications, enough ready-to-eat food and water to last three days, first-aid supplies,
// candles and matches or flashlights, a waterproof container for essential documents, and items
// needed by older adults and persons with disabilities; and
// 5) prepare a to-go kit that is ready in case of quick departure and includes a flashlight, extra
// batteries, a battery-operated radio, a first-aid kit, contact lenses or eye glasses, medications,
// copies of prescriptions, photo identification, copies of essential documents (birth certificate,
// marriage certificate, Social Security card, and Medicare, Medicaid and other insurance cards),
// and a small amount of cash (a maximum of $50).
