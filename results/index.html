                <h2>Why is this information useful?</h2>
    
                <p>Knowing what items to have in the event of a disaster is the same as knowing what <br>
                    tools to have before working on a project. Being caught off-guard, or lacking in a <br>
                    particular item could lead to serious consequences. That is why we wish to urge all to <br>
                    ensure that they have 100% of the essential items, and at minimum 80% of the needed <br>
                    items. These items are the most recommended to aid in the event of a disaster. <br>
                    Below you can check how many items you have, and what you are missing.

                <h2>Storing & Caring</h2>
                <p>You now have your emergency kit made and ready for use. That's awesome! Only, one <br>
                    issue: there isn't a situation where it is currently needed. Hopefully, there should<br>
                    <strong>never</strong> be a situation you find yourself in where you'll need it, but disasters <br>
                    can always occur. Which is why you also need to be familiar with how to care for and store these <br>
                    useful kits in preparation for <em>if</em> the time ever does arise.

                The items you've put together in this emergency kit are items that could save your, and another <br>
                person's life one day. So keeping each item in top condition should be a top concern. Keeping no food
                <br>
                that can spoil is important, but also ensuring that you periodically check to ensure nothing ever truly
                <br>
                goes bad in terms of food. Ensure no dents form in any of the cans and no signs of entry are visible.
                Outside <br>
                of food items, make it a habit to ensure all items are fresh and working(ex: medication up to date).
                <br>
                Keep all the items in an area that can be easily accessed in the event of a disaster. While most
                disasters <br>
                are broadcasted along the news of their incoming threat, some can spring at any moments notice. Which
                means you <br>
                should have this kit somewhere accessible at the drop of a hat.
